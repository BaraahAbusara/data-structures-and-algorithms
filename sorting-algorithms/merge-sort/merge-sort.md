# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
This challenge asks me to sort an array using merge sort algorithm. 
## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the array into two parts recursively until we have individual elements then we sort each half and return until we have the full array back sorted.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
- Time: O(nlog(n))
    - The basic operation of this algorithm is dividing the array into two parts recursively until we have individual elements then we sort each half and return until we have the full array back sorted.
- Space: O(n)
